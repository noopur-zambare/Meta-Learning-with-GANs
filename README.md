# Meta-Reinforcement-Learning-with-GANs

The Meta-Reinforcement Learning with GANs (Meta-RL-GAN) technique is an advanced method in the field of machine learning that integrates components of meta-learning, reinforcement learning, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to augment the process of learning inside a meta-learning framework. 

The primary objective of Meta-RL-GAN is not solely focused on attaining enhanced accuracy in a singular task, but rather on facilitating the model's capacity to adapt and exhibit improved generalisation capabilities across a diverse array of tasks.
